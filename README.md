# kctiDAO-governance
Modular governance and zk-credential smart contract system for Optimism-native DAOs.
# 🏛️ kctiDAO – Decentralized Governance Resilience Engine

**kctiDAO** is a modular, upgradable governance protocol for DAOs on Layer 2 ecosystems. Built with security, adaptability, and zk-credential tooling in mind, it introduces:

- ✅ Byzantine Fault Tolerant (dBFT) proposal engine
- 🔐 Emergency circuit breakers + fallback consensus
- ⛓️ Cross-chain abstraction layer (future rollup support)
- 📄 zk-identity credential minter (IPFS + W3UP)
- 🔎 Delegate slashing, anomaly detection, reputation decay

> Designed for **Optimism-native** DAOs and public goods orgs.

| `EmergencyProtocols.sol` | Emergency resolution, fallback modes |
| `BridgeAdapter.sol` | Future: abstract base for cross-chain bridging |
| `CredentialMinter.tsx` | zkIPFS credential UI form |
